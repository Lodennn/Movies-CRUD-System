# SrvKee Task

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Used Packages

### `Redux`

I've used Redux as a wide-state managemenet system to handle global state through the application.

### `Redux Toolkit`

I've used Redux Toolkit to take advantage of `imguer` and the flexible functionalities of Redux Toolkit package.

### `Redux Persist`

Redux Persist is my favorite when it comes to caching data into storage so i've used `Redux Persist` to handle my 
localStorage through it.


## Features

### `Full CRUD System`

The user can create, read, update and delete movies and categories in an easy way with a real good ui design.

### `SnackBar`

I've created a `SnackBar` logic to inform the user what is happening in the system when he interacts with our system.

## Technologies[Development]

### `Custom Hooks`

I've created two main custom hooks which helped me out in `Form` especially `use-input` and `use-form` which
saved me alot of time, made me avoid `DRY` Principle, and it makes things really dynamic.

### `SASS`

I've used sass as css pre-processor to manage my styling in an efficient and fast way and it was really helpful.

### `Git/Github`

I've used Git as a version controller to trace my project files and to make it organized.

### `Dynamic Responsive Design`

I've used sass to manage my responsive design(based on fonts) by adding `mixins` that takes a parameter of screen-width
and for that it detects which style i want to add as content.

## `UI Design`

For UI Design I've used `Adobe XD` to design the UI to make it easier to imagine the system and the styling in development process.
